# My Personal Site

Take a look at [dillonvanhorn.com](https://dillonvanhorn.com/)

This is my playground for Ruby on Rails.

Currently contains an about me page, and other tabs of various projects, like a Stock Portfolio Rebalancing tool that calculates the necessary buys for a given contribution to rebalance a portfolio back to its designated asset weights.
